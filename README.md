more info forthcoming. currently building the development toolchain.


## packages

`@audio/remix` - a minimal development environment for developing javascript react applications. currently supports the babel and webpack standard with some lighter replacements coming soon. typescript support is the next big priority here.

## getting started
```sh
# `yarn >=2.0.0` is required to get up and running. this will suffice to grab yarn for the first time or update you.
npm install -g yarn;

# grab the code and install the dependencies.
git clone https://github.com/bitsbybrad/audi.ooo.git && cd audi.ooo && yarn;

# run the development environment. this currently just stands up a webpack-dev-server on 3000.
yarn dev;
```
